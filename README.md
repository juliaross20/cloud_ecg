This software project provides a web service deployed on a public-facing Virtual Machine at this addresss: vcm@vcm-1845.vm.duke.edu. Any internet-connected client can access and use this web service. The web service has two major end points that provide heart rate calculations and bradycardia/tachycardia annotation. The first end point is /api_code/heart_rate/summary. It requires the user input a json containing the key value pairs of time and voltage, which are the same size. The web service will return a json containing key value pairs of time, instantaneous heart rate, bradycardia annotations (based on instantaneous heart rate), and tachycardia annotations (based on instantaneous heart rate). The arrays will be the same size as the user input. The second major end point is /api_code/heart_rate/average. The user must provide a json with key value pairs of time and voltage (same size) as well as an averaging period in seconds. This averaging period determines the bin size for calculating average heart rate. The web service then returns a json containing the same averaging period and time data as well as average heart rate, bradycardia annotations, and tachycardia annotations. The arrays are the same size as the user input. There is an additional feature of the webservice at /api_code/requests which provides the total numebr of requests made to the service since its most recent reboot.
